Objectives:
Develop a model capable of classifying 12 seedling categories with high accuracy.
Ensure robustness against variations like lighting, angles, and seedling conditions.
Evaluate performance with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Lay a foundation for scalability to larger datasets or real-time applications.
Methodology:
Neural Network Architecture:

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with architectures like ResNet-50 or VGG-16 was identified as optimal due to its image-specific capabilities.
The implemented model includes:
Convolutional Layers: Feature extraction.
Pooling Layers: Dimensionality reduction.
Dense Layers: Classification.
Data Processing:

Augmentation: Applied techniques (e.g., rotation, shifts, zoom, flipping) to increase dataset diversity.
Normalization: Scaled pixel values to [0,1] for consistent input.
Train-Validation-Test Split: 70%-15%-15% split, ensuring class balance with stratified sampling.
Training:

Loss function: Categorical crossentropy.
Optimizer: Adam with an initial learning rate of 0.001.
Early stopping monitored validation loss to prevent overfitting.
Evaluation:

Metrics: Accuracy, F1-score, and a confusion matrix for class-specific insights.
Deployment:

The trained model is saved for inference and future retraining.
Outcomes:
The CNN achieved strong performance on training, validation, and test datasets.
Training and validation losses were plotted to monitor progress.
Test metrics indicated effective generalization to unseen data, with a high F1 score confirming robust classification.
Key Improvements and Next Steps:
Expand the dataset for underrepresented classes.
Incorporate transfer learning with pre-trained models to enhance performance.
Optimize hyperparameters for further improvements.
This project demonstrates the potential for automated seedling classification in precision agriculture, aiding sustainable farming practices.
